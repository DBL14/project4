Mind Snap takes a snapshot of how a user feels at a particular moment in a paticular location. This helps the user to remember events and how he experienced them and possible causes of those feelings. This will help the user to develop his self awareness and self improvement. 

Technologies used included HTML, HTML Geolocation, CSS, Node.js, Express, Mongo and Angular.js. I designed the layout to be easy to use for the user to record moments quickly and to be responsive to different screen sizes. 

Using the Angular Google Static Map directive, the longitude and latitude coordinates of saved moments from the HTML Geolocator can be accessed to display where the user was at the time he recorded an event. Using the Angular ng-repeat directive, the user can access the latest saved moments from other users.
